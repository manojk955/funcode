<h2>Implement read line in clojure by example</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Read line statements are used to read input into a clojure function defined previously<br>
<li>But the problem is the input can only be read as strings<br>
 <li> user=> (println "Enter input ") <br>
        (def x (read-line)) <br>
        (println (str "Your input is \"" x "\"")) <br>
</ul>
